### **Database Schema**
New tables added with full backward compatibility:
- `resource_profiles` - Enhanced resource data with AI learning fields
- `skill_proficiencies` - Detailed skill tracking with trends
- `task_intelligence` - Enhanced task data with complexity and collaboration metrics
- `resource_utilization_metrics` - Historical utilization tracking
- `ai_assignment_recommendations` - Cached AI recommendations
- Automated data collection tables for git commits, communication, help requests

## üîß Implementation Details

### **Task-Based Utilization Engine**

The core innovation is moving from hour-based to task-based capacity management:

```typescript
// Example: Calculate utilization based on task count and complexity
const utilization = await utilizationEngine.calculateTaskUtilization(resourceId, 'week');
// Returns: task count, weighted load, complexity distribution, bottleneck risk
```

**Key Features:**
- Considers task complexity, urgency, and context switching penalties
- Learns optimal task capacity from historical performance
- Adjusts for collaboration requirements and deep focus needs
- Predicts completion rates and identifies bottleneck risks

### **AI Assignment Intelligence**

Multi-factor scoring system for optimal resource assignment:

```typescript
// Example: Get AI recommendations for project assignment
const recommendations = await assignmentAI.suggestOptimalAssignment(projectId, availableResources);
// Returns: ranked recommendations with detailed reasoning
```

**Scoring Factors:**
- **Capacity Fit (25%)**: How well current load matches optimal utilization
- **Skill Match (30%)**: Proficiency alignment with task requirements
- **Work Style Fit (20%)**: Collaboration vs focus requirements
- **Learning Value (15%)**: Growth opportunities and skill development
- **Quality Prediction (10%)**: Expected output quality based on historical data

### **Automated Data Collection**

Integrates with existing tools to gather insights without manual input:

```typescript
// Example: Configure data collection
const dataCollectionService = new AutomatedDataCollectionService({
  git_repositories: [{ url: 'github.com/org/repo', access_token: '...' }],
  task_management_integrations: [{ platform: 'jira', api_key: '...' }],
  communication_platforms: [{ platform: 'slack', channels: ['#dev'] }],
  polling_intervals: { git_commits: 15, task_updates: 30, communication: 60 }
});
```

**Data Collection Sources:**
- **Git Commits**: Links commits to tasks, tracks complexity and file changes
- **Task Platforms**: Monitors status changes, completion times, rework cycles
- **Communication**: Identifies help requests, collaboration patterns, sentiment
- **Performance**: Calculates velocity, quality scores, learning progress

## üîÑ Integration & Compatibility

### **Backward Compatibility**
The enhanced system maintains full compatibility with existing resource management:

```typescript
// Legacy interface still works
const { resources, updateResource, assignToProject } = useResources();

// Enhanced features available through new interface
const { resourceProfiles, getTaskUtilization, getAssignmentRecommendations } = useEnhancedResources();
```

### **Migration Strategy**
1. **Database Migration**: New tables created alongside existing ones
2. **Data Sync**: Legacy resources automatically converted to enhanced profiles
3. **Gradual Adoption**: Teams can use new features incrementally
4. **Fallback Support**: System works even with partial data collection setup
